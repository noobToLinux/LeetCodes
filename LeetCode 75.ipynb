    "Like any other problem, my first intuition was let's brute force the solution by having two pointers going from i-1 to 1 and i+1 to len(nums) and multiplying each element and then appending this result to the output array. However, on secondary thought (and mainly due to solving questions such as Prefix Sum and Postfix Sum before), I could observe that we can use similar concept like Prefix and Postfix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "We use the fact that prefix_product of arr\\[i\\] is arr\\[0\\] * arr\\[1\\] * .. * arr\\[i-1\\] and postfix_product of arr\\[i\\] is arr\\[i+1\\] * arr\\[i+2\\] * .. * arr\\[n-1\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically, we have to calculate prefix_product * postfix_product\\[i\\] for each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most solutions implementing the concept of Prefix and Postfix would suggest 2 traversals, however I felt that we could one-up that and come up with a single for-loop solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize a Solution Array of same size as input array with value.\n",
    "2. Store Prefix and Postfix Product so far in variables.\n",
    "3. Traverse the input array.\n",
    "4. Before updating the values for each i, multiply current solution array value at i with the value of prefix i.e. multiply with prefix product of the previous i-1 elements.\n",
    "5. Similarly, calculate the postfix product value for n-i-1 where n is length of input array at each iteration.\n",
    "6. As in Step 4, before calculating the postfix for i'th value , multiply the solution_array\\[n-i-1\\] with the postfix product value i.e. products of input\\[i+1\\] to input\\[n-1\\].\n",

    "    * The above vertical lines are represented by array \\[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7\\]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.\n",
    "* height = \\[1,1\\] -> 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intuition:\n",
    "The two-pointer technique starts with the widest container and moves the pointers inward based on the comparison of heights.\n",
    "Increasing the width of the container can only lead to a larger area if the height of the new boundary is greater. By moving the pointers towards the center, we explore containers with the potential for greater areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "1. Initialize the variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * left to represent the left pointer, starting at the beginning of the container (index 0).\n",
    "    * right to represent the right pointer, starting at the end of the container (index height.size() - 1).\n",
    "    * maxArea to keep track of the maximum area found, initially set to 0.\n",
    "2. Enter a loop using the condition left < right, which means the pointers have not crossed each other yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate the current area:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use the min function to find the minimum height between the left and right pointers.\n",
    "    * Multiply the minimum height by the width, which is the difference between the indices of the pointers: (right - left).\n",
    "    * Store this value in the currentArea variable.\n",
    "4. Update the maximum area:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use the max function to compare the currentArea with the maxArea.\n",
    "    * If the currentArea is greater than the maxArea, update maxArea with the currentArea.\n",
    "5. Move the pointers inward: (Explained in detail below)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Check if the height at the left pointer is smaller than the height at the right pointer.\n",
    "    * If so, increment the left pointer, moving it towards the center of the container.\n",
    "    * Otherwise, decrement the right pointer, also moving it towards the center.\n",
    "6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until the pointers meet (left >= right), indicating that all possible containers have been explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Return the maxArea, which represents the maximum area encountered among all the containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update the maximum area:\n",
    "The purpose of this condition is to determine which pointer to move inward, either the left pointer (i) or the right pointer (j), based on the comparison of heights at their respective positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have two containers represented by the heights at the left and right pointers. The condition checks which container has a smaller height and moves the pointer corresponding to that container.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If height\\[i\\] > height\\[j\\]:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * This means that the height of the left container is greater than the height of the right container.\n",
    "    * Moving the right pointer (j) would not increase the potential area because the height of the right container is the limiting factor.\n",
    "    * So, to explore containers with the possibility of greater areas, we need to move the right pointer inward by decrementing j.\n",
    "2. If height\\[i\\] <= height\\[j\\]:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * This means that the height of the left container is less than or equal to the height of the right container.\n",
    "    * Moving the left pointer (i) would not increase the potential area because the height of the left container is the limiting factor.\n",
    "    * So, to explore containers with the possibility of greater areas, we need to move the left pointer inward by incrementing i.\n",
    "By making these pointer movements, we ensure that we are always exploring containers with the potential for larger areas. The approach is based on the observation that increasing the width of the container can only lead to a larger area if the height of the new boundary is greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this condition and moving the pointers accordingly, the algorithm explores all possible containers and finds the one with the maximum area."

    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intuition\n",
    "The intuition behind this solution is to use a two-pointer approach on a sorted array. Sorting the array allows us to efficiently find pairs of numbers that sum up to the target value k. The two pointers (left and right) are initialized at the beginning and end of the sorted array, and we move them towards each other based on the sum of the numbers at those positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach\n",
    "Sort the array: We begin by sorting the input array nums. Sorting is essential for the two-pointer approach. using the nums.sort()\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate with two pointers: Use a while loop to iterate until left pointer is less than right pointer.\n",
    "- If the sum of nums\\[left\\] and nums\\[right\\] is equal to the target k, we have found a pair, so we increment the operation count and move both pointers towards the center\n",
    "- If the sum is less than k, we need a larger sum, so we move the left pointer to the right.\n",
    "- If the sum is greater than k, we need a smaller sum, so we move the right pointer to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the count: After the while loop completes, return the operation count, which represents the maximum number of pairs that can be formed to achieve the target sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complexity\n",
    "* Time complexity:\n",
    "    * The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is typically O(n log n) for the average case. The two-pointer traversal of the sorted array is O(n), so the overall time complexity is O(n log n)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Space complexity:\n",
